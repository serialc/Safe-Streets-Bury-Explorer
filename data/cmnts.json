If you are considering seriously to improve and  increase walk/cycle routes please keep the distance as short as possible, adapt and add to off road paths for cyclists/walkers why not make further improvements and widen existing off-road pathways, use paths by old train tracks when and if you can.  I wont use a bike until there are no potholes or drains ( last time I biked to Bury and back to Brandlesholme I couldn't sit down for two weeks as the many bumps in the road damaged my coxic! So if you are truly serious about getting us on our bikes you have to consider long term health and safety implications to the cyclists.  In places the ludicrous  cyclists-line I was supposed to stay in was inches wide, its a joke.  I would love to have at least a footpath of width and I think there is a need for metal barriers to seperate motor vehicles from cyclists, and where possible keep cyclists and vehicles apart, improve off road routes, eg. at Kirklees - add to it.  Just because we use a bike doesn't mean we want to make our journey extra long.  We want to get to a place as quickly as possible, whether we are in a motor vehicle or not, especially with our inclement weather. New builds and houses built since the 70's have cut off our off road walking routes ( Used to be able to walk comfortably from  Rudgwick  Drive /Brandlesholme road (site of previous Old Duke Pub) to Burrs woods but now you have an impassable route behind houses (opposite the Dentists) and fences squashed between brambles, nettles, unpleasant walking and  barriers to stop bikes!<br>Quickest route on a bike from top of Brandlesholme  to Bury is the main road but its unpleasant, unsafe and unhealthy in its state.  I got tired of having to pull out of the cycle lane to go around parked cars, and buses  I hardly saw anyone walking on the pavements.<br>If you put more speeding restrictions for motorists traffic will just back up.  Morning rush hour on Brandlesholme road is appalling.  You have to think if it takes 10 minutes in a car to get to town how can we make it 15 minutes on a bike.  I am sure you will increase bike use but I would not let my family onto the main road.  Bus provision is terrible too, many walk to sites of Bury educational settings and it a 40/45 min walk, because bus service is inadequate.<br>Why not put up signs informing pedestrians of short routes to schools/colleges and improve the backstreet pathways.<br>I think bring back trains, introduce connections to Rossendale.  Forward thinking.  We all hate traffic jams Bury on a friday evening is gridlocked, why is this because its the only way to travel quickly and safely, weather plays a part we cant turn up to work like a drowned rat.  I feel the motorist is punished and this is wrong.  Consider other options for cyslists and pedestrians.  If possible open up pathways that house build have over the years blocked off.  Keep the routes as the crow flies whatever is being considered.

It means that people turning right onto Ogden St often have to mount the pavement on the school side of the road to get into Ogden St.  It would be helpful to turn Ogden St into a one way street, and narrow the exit  at the junction with Whittaker Lane, so that there is no possible place way cars can park there.  This will also make a safer junction for children crossing the road here, going to and from the school.

The double parking that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s now occurring is causing vehicles to be damaged more, it has been seen that some residents have also fully blocked the pavements with their vehicles in the past causing pedestrians to walk in the road and or on the grass verges.  This is an accident waiting to happen without social distancing even coming into the equation.  I can not afford a vehicle now since my vehicle was written off several years ago, I can not carry my shopping from the main road, along with most residents here, I have to rely on online shopping which on occasion the delivery driver has not been able to park due to the amount of vehicles parked on both sides of the road.  It is a vulnerable community here and disabilities are not being taken into account.  The speeding on this road is a huge issue and although the grassed areas look pretty they are not practical, one side of the road is able to hold the weight of vehicles as it was used as a compound by United utilities several years ago the other side I understand has machinery/containers underneath and that it probably wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t hold vehicle weight, there is no reason why a parking area at the bungalows could not be made on the side able to hold the weight and a lay by on the other side.

Speeding has been a problem for ages and Bury Council have proposed a potential Road Safety Scheme ref. TM8655. This involves 2 pedestrian refuges by the car park on Lumb Carr Road (which needs enlarging as double parking is now a big problem for cyclists) and by the School. This scheme is for the whole road, Lumb Carr Road and Helmshore Road, from Holcombe Brooke along the Lancashire Cycleway to the Borough boundary. Last year both the Iron Man event and the Tour of Britain cycle races went through Holcombe. Please reconsider a 20mph deterrant system as the police recognize the dangers but have little resource to enforce.

Now it is vital we protect our visitors and our residents better. . <br>Holcombe has a key safety bollard at the junction of LCR and Cross Lane. This has been knocked down 18 times  and shows the dangers ; this bollard needs a redesign at its location to stop this abuse by careless motorists.

Many (not all) do not pay attention to road rules & regulations, sometimes you can not see them owing to a lack of lighting & wearing dark clothing, sometimes they have those strobe lights that dazzle drivers. Apply laws and rules to cyclists if they are going to use the roads to keep it safe for everybody & any cyclist riding on the footpath without a very good reason (young child for instance, perhaps an age restriction should be put in place?) should be fined. Also any cyclist with headphones or using a mobile phone should be clamped down on, one nearly crashed into me last week as they were texting & riding.","abdate":"2020-06-12"}}
