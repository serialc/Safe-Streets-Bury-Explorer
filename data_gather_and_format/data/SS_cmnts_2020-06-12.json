If you are considering seriously to improve and  increase walk/cycle routes please keep the distance as short as possible, adapt and add to off road paths for cyclists/walkers why not make further improvements and widen existing off-road pathways, use paths by old train tracks when and if you can.  I wont use a bike until there are no potholes or drains ( last time I biked to Bury and back to Brandlesholme I couldn't sit down for two weeks as the many bumps in the road damaged my coxic! So if you are truly serious about getting us on our bikes you have to consider long term health and safety implications to the cyclists.  In places the ludicrous  cyclists-line I was supposed to stay in was inches wide, its a joke.  I would love to have at least a footpath of width and I think there is a need for metal barriers to seperate motor vehicles from cyclists, and where possible keep cyclists and vehicles apart, improve off road routes, eg. at Kirklees - add to it.  Just because we use a bike doesn't mean we want to make our journey extra long.  We want to get to a place as quickly as possible, whether we are in a motor vehicle or not, especially with our inclement weather. New builds and houses built since the 70's have cut off our off road walking routes ( Used to be able to walk comfortably from  Rudgwick  Drive /Brandlesholme road (site of previous Old Duke Pub) to Burrs woods but now you have an impassable route behind houses (opposite the Dentists) and fences squashed between brambles, nettles, unpleasant walking and  barriers to stop bikes!\nQuickest route on a bike from top of Brandlesholme  to Bury is the main road but its unpleasant, unsafe and unhealthy in its state.  I got tired of having to pull out of the cycle lane to go around parked cars, and buses  I hardly saw anyone walking on the pavements.\nIf you put more speeding restrictions for motorists traffic will just back up.  Morning rush hour on Brandlesholme road is appalling.  You have to think if it takes 10 minutes in a car to get to town how can we make it 15 minutes on a bike.  I am sure you will increase bike use but I would not let my family onto the main road.  Bus provision is terrible too, many walk to sites of Bury educational settings and it a 40/45 min walk, because bus service is inadequate.\nWhy not put up signs informing pedestrians of short routes to schools/colleges and improve the backstreet pathways.\nI think bring back trains, introduce connections to Rossendale.  Forward thinking.  We all hate traffic jams Bury on a friday evening is gridlocked, why is this because its the only way to travel quickly and safely, weather plays a part we cant turn up to work like a drowned rat.  I feel the motorist is punished and this is wrong.  Consider other options for cyslists and pedestrians.  If possible open up pathways that house build have over the years blocked off.  Keep the routes as the crow flies whatever is being considered.

Get rid of the pointless confusing buss lane and build a segregated cycle lane. The road layout and traffic lights need altering where customers pull out of Liddel.

Other residents have had vehicles written off, I am one of those residents, the vehicle speeds on this road are beyond a joke and getting out of your vehicles can be a nightmare in itself when your limited on movement due to disability or age.  The double parking that’s now occurring is causing vehicles to be damaged more, it has been seen that some residents have also fully blocked the pavements with their vehicles in the past causing pedestrians to walk in the road and or on the grass verges.  This is an accident waiting to happen without social distancing even coming into the equation.  I can not afford a vehicle now since my vehicle was written off several years ago, I can not carry my shopping from the main road, along with most residents here, I have to rely on online shopping which on occasion the delivery driver has not been able to park due to the amount of vehicles parked on both sides of the road.  It is a vulnerable community here and disabilities are not being taken into account.  The speeding on this road is a huge issue and although the grassed areas look pretty they are not practical, one side of the road is able to hold the weight of vehicles as it was used as a compound by United utilities several years ago the other side I understand has machinery/containers underneath and that it probably wouldn’t hold vehicle weight, there is no reason why a parking area at the bungalows could not be made on the side able to hold the weight and a lay by on the other side.  Past excuses have included it can not hold vehicle weight to cost, obviously it’s going to cost money but safety is more important when you see the kinds of driving taking place on the road and also the hgv’s/buses that run on this road too.  Due to poor driving I have personally been left without a car and also seen several aftermaths of accidents where vehicles have hit the wall at the car wash, demolished a telegraph pole/lamppost even the pedestrian crossings have been taken out yet nothing ever  changes regarding the state of this road.  Vulnerable residents vehicles should not be used as an excuse to slow the flow of traffic, this clearly isn’t working is it??? Maybe help the residents and do some traffic calming measures, we have nursery and primary school kids walking on this road going to and from Radcliffe Hall primary and close park, are they not entitled to be safe on the pavements?
